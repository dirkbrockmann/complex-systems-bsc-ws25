In this introductory lecture, we will explore what complex systems are: how one will characterize a complex system,
what the difference between complex and complicated will be.

We will carry out a little word cloud experiment in class concerning concepts and words we will typically associate with **Complex Systems**.

We will also discuss what Complexity Science will be, how it will differ from traditional fields of science.
