This little adventure explores and explains the properties of a famous discrete time dynamical systems, 
known as the [***logistic map***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map). 

The logistic map looks like this:

$$
x_{n+1}=\lambda x_{n}(1-x_{n})\quad\text{with}\quad n=0,1,2,3...
$$

Given a starting value $0\leq x_{0}\leq1$ and a positive and fixed parameter $0 < \lambda <4 $ 
the map produces a sequence of values

$$
x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},...
$$

that you get by iterating it, e.g.

$$
x_{1}  =\lambda x_{0}(1-x_{0})
$$
$$
x_{2}  =\lambda x_{1}(1-x_{1})
$$

$$
...
$$

and so forth. 

Before we discuss some fascinating properties of this
map, its richness, and set of unexpected behaviors, let's first
motivate it and connect it to applications and natural systems.

### Motivation

It turns out that the logistic map can be motivated using a
biological/ecological context.

Let's assume we have a population of a species in which individuals
***replicate***. Let's say, for simplicity that in every 
generation $n=0,1,2,...$
an individual has on average $\lambda$ offspring before it dies. 
This could be any positive number. It doesn't have to be an integer 
because we think of this as an average or an expected number of 
offspring. So if say
$\lambda=1.5$ then on average each individual has $1.5$ offspring
before it dies, for instance if in 50% of cases an individual 
has one offspring and in 50% of the cases 2 offspring, 
we get $\lambda=1.5$.

We call the parameter $\lambda$ the ***reproduction rate***.

<Figure src={logistic_map_fig1} srcDark={logistic_map_fig1Dark} alt="Exponential Growth." margin={true}>
**Exponential Growth and Decay:** Depending on the growth rate $\lambda 
we see exponential  growth or decay. 
Initial population $U_0=400$
</Figure>


Now let's say the population at time $n=0$ has $U_{n}$ individuals.
A generation later the population size will be
$$
U_{n+1}=\lambda U_{n}
$$
Therefore, if we start with an initial population $U_{0}$ we get
$$
U_{n}=\lambda^{n}U_{0}
$$
which we can write as
$$
U_{n}=e^{\ln\lambda}U_{0}
$$
So, depending on the value of $\lambda$ we can have two different
scenarios.

- If $ 0 < \lambda < 1 $ then $ \ln \lambda < 0$ and thus $U _{n+1}<U _{n} $, 
  the population dies out. This makes total sense if the typical 
  number of offspring is less that one.
- If $\lambda>1$ on the other we have $\ln\lambda>0$ and 
  thus $U_{n+1}>U_{n}$: the population grows indefinitely 
  and exponentially.

So, if we only have replication and a reproduction rate  $\lambda>1$ 
we expect exponential growth. Now, this can't go on forever. 
Other factors will come into play if the population gets
too big, e.g. ***limiting resources***, ***competition***, 
***limited space***, etc. One way
to account for this is by saying that the reproduction 
rate $\lambda$ effectively depends in some way on the size 
of the population:
$$
\lambda=\lambda(U)
$$

<Figure src={logistic_map_fig2} srcDark={logistic_map_fig2Dark} alt="Logistic Growth." margin={true}>
**Population limited Growth:** Two possible population size dependent reproduction rates $\lambda(U)$, linear and exponential decrease, respectively, for capacities of $C=400$ 
and basic reproduction rate $\lambda_0=3.2$.
</Figure>

We introduce a ***capacity $C$*** which we think of as a 
large population size that, if reached, reduces reproduction 
to zero or a very small number. Plus we would
like to keep reproduction at some maximum value $\lambda_{0}$ if
$U\ll C$. What are the choices? Here'e one:

$$
\lambda=\lambda_{0}e^{-U/C}
$$

In this case

$$
\lambda\approx\lambda_{0}\quad\text{if}\quad U\ll C
$$

and

$$
\lambda\approx0\quad\text{if}\quad U\gg C
$$

An even simpler choice is a linear decrease

$$
\lambda=\lambda_{0}(1-U/C)
$$

which is very similar but potentially easier to handle mathematically. 

With this choice we get
$$
U_{n+1}=\lambda_{0}(1-U_{n}/C)U_{n}
$$
which we can iterated for a chosen set of parameters $\lambda$ and
$C$ and an initial population $U_{0}<C$.

Now we can simplify this a bit by expressing the population as a 
fraction of the capacity $C$:

$$
x_{n}=U_{n}/C.
$$

Using the new quantity we get

$$
x_{n+1}=\lambda_{0}(1-x_{n})x_{n}.
$$

We can just drop the subscript $0$ of $\lambda_{0}$ and arrive at
the logistic map

$$
x_{n+1}=\lambda(1-x_{n})x_{n}.
$$

Let's play with this equation a bit. In **the panel below** you 
can observe the sequence $x_{n}$ for 
parameters $x_{0}$ and $\lambda$ of your choice. 
If $ 1 < \lambda < 3 $ we get a sequence
$x_{n}$ that quickly approaches a fixed value.

<Explorable id="figure_2" margin={false}>    
    **Time series of the logistic map:** The sequence $x_n$ generated by the 
    logistic map for a few  values. Change the initial value $x _{0}$ and the 
    reproduction rate $\lambda$ with the sliders. You can observe that 
    for reproduction in the range $1 < \lambda < 3$ the solution 
    approaches a stable fixed value. As you increase $\lambda$ a 
    succession of period doubling events occurs and eventually 
    the sequence becomes **aperiodic**.
    <Fig2 slot="figure" client:load id="logistic_sequence"/>
</Explorable>


If we increase the reproduction rate to $\lambda>3.0$ we observe
a different behavior: The population doesn't seem to equilibrate to
a fixed value, but rather seems to oscillate 
in a ***period-2-cycle***. 
Regardless of the initial condition $x_{0}$ the 
system always approaches
this cycle. 

Let's go to even higher values. For $\lambda=3.8$
we see even for very long sequences no apparent regular
or periodic pattern of values emerges. The sequence of 
values $x_{n}$ seems random and ***chaotic***. In fact, 
the sequence never repeats and becomes **aperiodic**. 
More about this below.

## One dimensional maps

In order to understand this behavior better, let's back up a bit and
think of a system like the logistic map in more general terms. The
logistic map is an example of a ***one-dimensional discrete time map***:
$$
x_{n+1}=f(x_{n})
$$
where in our case
$$
f(x)=\lambda x(1-x).
$$
The question that arises typically is how the system behaves for long
times so when $n\rightarrow\infty$.

### Fixpoints

The first step we usually take is trying to identify special points,
called ***fixed points*** or short ***fixpoints***. These are values for $x$
that remain invariant if we plug them into the iterated map, so:
$$
x_{n+1}=x_{n}
$$
and
$$
x_{n}=f(x_{n}).
$$
Iterated maps can have none, one or many such points and sometimes
it's difficult to compute them. In our case we can compute the fixpoints: 
$$
x=\lambda x(1-x)
$$
which has solutions
$$
x^{\star}=0
$$
and
$$
x^{\star}=1-\frac{1}{\lambda}.
$$


<Figure src={logistic_map_fig3} srcDark={logistic_map_fig3Dark} alt="Fixpoints graphically." margin={true}>
**Fixpoints graphically:** Fixpoints of a 1-d iterated map $g(x)$ are the 
intersection of the function $g(x)$ with the diagonal. 
In this case the map $x_{n+1}=g(x_n)$ has 4 fixpoints.
</Figure>


We see that the first one always exists and the second one exists
if $\lambda>1$. So if we start with $x_{0}=x^{\star}$ we will have
$$
x_{n+1}=x^{\star}
$$
 for all times. But what happens if we don't start with $x_{0}=x^{\star}$?
Let's try this with $\lambda=5/2$ and some $x_{0}$ we see that
after a few iterations the values of $x_{n}$ are approaching the
fixpoint
$$
x^{\star}=1-\frac{1}{\lambda}=3/5=0.6
$$
This fixpoint seems to be ***attractive*** and we call it an ***attractor***. Even if we start very close
to the other fixpoint $x^{\star}=0$ say with $x_{0}=0.001$ we see
that the values $x_{n}$ are repelled by it (we call that fixpoint a ***repeller***) and attracted by the non-zero fixpoint.

Apart from doing the computations to determine the fixpoints we can
find the fixpoints graphically. All we have to do is to draw the function
$y_{1}=f(x)$ and the diagonal $y_{2}=x$. When these two curves intersect
we have 
$$
x=f(x).
$$


For the logistic map we see that $f(x)$ is an inverse parabola that
meets the $x$-axis at zero and one, and intersects with the diagonal
$x$ only at $x=0$ if $\lambda<1$ and also at a non-trivial intermediate
value if $\lambda>1$, consistent with the calculations we did.


<Figure src={logistic_map_fig4} srcDark={logistic_map_fig4Dark} alt="Fixpoints of the logistic mal." margin={true}>
Fixpoints of the logistic map are the two solutions 
to $x=f(x)$ which are the trivial fixpoint $x^\star=0$ 
and if $\lambda>1$ we also have $x^\star=1-1/\lambda$.
</Figure>


### Stability

There's a way to determine the stability of a fixpoint, to check whether a fixpoint is an attractor or a repeller. Let's assume
that we have a fixpoint $x^{\star}$. And we start off with an initial
value that's a little bit off so that 
$$
x_{0}=x^{\star}+\delta x_{0}.
$$
Now we compute
$$
x_{1}=f(x_{0})=f(x^{\star}+\delta x_{0}).
$$
In the vicinity of the fixpoint, if $\delta x_{0}$ is very small
we can expand the function $f$:
$$
f(x^{\star}+\delta x_{0})\approx f(x^{\star}) + f\^{\prime}(x^{\star})\delta x_{0}
$$
so that
$$
x_{1}  \approx x\^{\star}+f\^{\prime}(x^{\star})\delta x_{0}
$$
So, after one iteration, what is the distance to the fixpoint? 
$$
\delta x_{1}\approx f\^{\prime}(x\^{\star})\delta x_{0}.
$$
So we see that if 
$$
|f\^{\prime}(x\^{\star})|>1
$$
 this distance to the fixpoint becomes larger and larger whereas if
$$
|f\^{\prime}(x\^{\star})|<1
$$
it becomes smaller and smaller. So it seems that this a condition
for the stability of a fixpoint.

Let's try to apply this to the logistic map. Here we have
$$
f(x)=\lambda x(1-x)
$$
which implies that
$$
f\^{\prime}(x)=\lambda-2\lambda x
$$
so that at the fixpoint $x\^{\star}=1-1/\lambda$ we get
$$
f\^{\prime}(x\^{\star})  =\lambda-2\left(\lambda-1\right)
 =2-\lambda
$$
Therefore, if $\lambda<3$ the fixpoint is stable because $|f\^{\prime}(x\^{\star})|<1$. But, if the reproduction rate increases beyond $3$
the fixpoint becomes unstable. The system no longer has a stable, attractive fixpoint.

Looking at the sequence $x_{n}$ say for $\lambda=3.3$ we see that the attractor is
something else: a period-2-cycle of alternating
values such that
$$
x_{n+2}=x_{n}=x_{A}^{\star}
$$
and
$$
x_{n+3}=x_{n+1}=x_{B}^{\star}
$$
We can think of both of these points that make that cycle as a fixpoint
of a new map:
$$
g=f\circ f
$$
which in words means we apply the orginal map twice, or
$$
g(x)  =f(f(x))
$$
$$
  =\lambda f(x)(1-f(x))
$$
$$
  =\lambda^{2}x(1-x)(1-\lambda x(1-x))
$$
This function is a more convoluted polynomial. If we want to compute the fixed points of $g(x)$, we proceed the same way by solving
$$
  x=\lambda^{2}x(1-x)(1-\lambda x(1-x))
$$
for x. You can do this as a practice problem.

## Graphic Analysis - Cobwebbing

We can visualize a trajectory by starting on the $x$-axis at
some point $x_{0}$ and drawing a vertical line to $f(x_{0})$. That
point is also $x_{1}$ and finding it on the $x$ axis is equivalent
to drawing a horizontal line towards the diagonal $x$. Now we can
draw another vertical link to $f(x_{1})$ and keep repeating the process
and eventually generate an entire trajectory this way. So, what we
are doing is plotting the sequence
$$
(x_{0},0),(x_{0},x_{1}),(x_{1},x_{1}),(x_{1},x_{2})....
$$
$$
....(x_{n},x_{n}),(x_{n},x_{n+1})....
$$
You can try this cobwebbing for the logistic map in **the panel below**.

<Explorable id="figure_3" margin={false}>
    **Orbit reconstruction by cobwebbing:**
    Two orbits are shown. You can vary the initial point $x_0$ for 
    each orbit with the slider. An orbit has a transient period and an 
    attractor. If you want to see the cascade of period doubling events, 
    switch off the transient part of the orbit and increase the reproduction
     rate $\lambda$ slowly.

## The road to chaos

So far we have observed that when $\lambda>1$ we have a single fixpoint
at $x^{\star}=1-1/\lambda$ that loses stability at a critical value
$\lambda_{2}=3$ when a stable period-2-cyle emerges. If we increase
$\lambda$ beyond $\lambda_{3}=3.449...$ we will see that the period-2-cycle
also loses stability. It is replaced by a new, stable and attractive
period-4-cycle. The points that make up this cycle are stable
fix-points of the quadruple map
$$
h=g\circ g=f\circ f\circ f\circ f.
$$
Now it turns out that this period-4-cycle doesn't remain stable for
long but at $\lambda_{4}=3.54409...$ is replaced by a stable period-8-cycle,
and so forth. 

What's important to note is that the critical points at which these
**period doubling events** occur, or rather there separation
becomes smaller and smaller and eventually at
$$
\lambda_{\infty}=3.569946...
$$
we have a ***period of infinity***. This means that although we have a ``cycle''
that is attractive, it's period is infinite, so it never repeats,
it is not longer really periodic. Rather is has become ***aperiodic*** and
chaotic. This was very confusing to people that first looked at the
simple logistic map. We can compute the ratio
$$
\delta=\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\lambda_{n}-\lambda_{n-1}}{\lambda_{n+1}-\lambda_{n}}=4.669
$$
The limit is known as **Feigenbaum's constant**. This is a universal constant
that keeps reappearing in systems like the logistic map and is intimitaly connected to chaotic systems. 

What's even more puzzling is that the periodic solutions
like the period-2-cycles, 4-cycles etc., although no longer stable in the chaotic regime,
still exist as repellers. So for $\lambda>\lambda_{\infty}$ we have
a very dense and infinite set of periodic orbits in the system all
of which are unstable. In fact, they have to _fit_ in the system somehow,
so actually for every point $x$ we have an inifite set of periodic orbits arbitrarily close to it.

## Bifurcation diagram

One way of illustrating the complexity of the situation is by what
is known as a bifurcation diagram. Instead of making different cobwebbing
plots for different choices of $\lambda$ and because we tend to be
interested in the asymptotic behavior of the system we plot the _attractors_
of the systems as a function of the parameter $\lambda$. A plot like
this is known as a ***bifurcation diagram***, a very important tool in the study
of dynamical systems. 
This is how it works:

- first we fix $\lambda$ and choose an initial condition
- we then iterate the map, say 10000 times for the transient part of the dynamics (which we then throw away)
- then we iterate say 1000 more times and plot the array of values vs. $\lambda$
- we then increment $\lambda$ and repeat the process

we now plot the $x$-values that we computed that represent the attractor on the $y-$axis and the $\lambda-$value on the $x$-axis. 

If for the chosen value of $\lambda$ we have say a period-8-cycle
that is attractive, all the collected 1000 points will be one of the
8 points that make up the period-8-cycle. So we would get 8 _dots_ in the plot. 
You can see what is happening in **the panel below**.

<Explorable id="figure_4" margin={false}>
    **The bifurcations in the logistic map:**
    As we increase $\lambda$ a cascade of period doubling events 
    leads to deterministic chaos. **You can click on a region that 
    interests you** on the plot to zoom in around that region 
    (After 6 zooming steps you will cycle back to the full display)
    <Fig4 slot="figure" client:load id="bifurcation"/>
</Explorable>

We clearly see the period doubling events as we increase $\lambda$.
We also see that at some point all the points are spread across a
wide range and form what looks like a continuun. 
Furthermore we see that there are weird self-similar structures
in the bifurcation diagram and also regimes of periodic behavior within
a _sea of chaos_. You can investigate this by zooming by clicking on a region of interest.

We see another generic feature of chaotic systems: ***self-similarity***.
This is particularly striking in the bifurcation diagram where we
see parts of the structure that resemble the whole structure only
smaller. You can see this by zooming in (clicking on the region of interest).

## Some properties of chaos

When the reproduction rate is larger than the critical parameter $\lambda_{\infty}$
and we have a regime where orbits are aperiodic, we have reached the
regime of ***deterministic chaos***. This means that even though
the orbits are deterministic, they seem irregular and unpredictable. 


We can also observe a sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
Let's say we start with an initial value $x_{0}$ and right next to
it with an initial value $\tilde{x}\_{0}=x\_{0}+\varepsilon$ where
$\varepsilon$ is tiny, say $10^{-6}$. In the chaotic regime after a few steps the
sequences $x_{n}$ and $\tilde{x}_{n}$ will become very different,
another hallmark of unpredictability. You can check this out in **the panel below**.
{/* {{< explorable

<Explorable id="figure_5" margin={false}>
    **Sensitive dependence on initial conditions:**
    The figure depicts two orbits $x _ n$ and $\tilde x_ n$ differeing 
    in their initial condition by a tiny bit $\varepsilon$. Increase the 
    reproduction parameter $\lambda$ into the chaotic regime and you will see both 
    trajectories diverge after a few iterations. Even if you then decrease $\varepsilon$ 
    to a very small value, the number of steps for which both trajectories 
    are similar doesn't increase significantly.

### Other systems

The logistic map with $f(x)=\lambda x (1-x)$ is the simplest conceivable
system that encorporates reproduction and self-regulation of a population. Because it is so simple
we can expect that models that are structurally similar but more realistic generate similar behavior
and that the funky effects observed in the logistic map are universal.

<Explorable id="figure_6" margin={false}>
    **Another bifurcation diagram:**
    This one illustrates the bifurcations and period doubling of 
    the map defined by $f(x)=\lambda x \exp (-x)$. **Again  click 
    on a region of interest to zoom in**.
    <Fig6 slot="figure" client:load id="bifurcation_expmap"/>
</Explorable>


**The above panel** illustrates the bifurcation diagram of the map

$$
x\_{n+1} = \lambda  x\_{n} \exp (-x\_{n})
$$

which isn't limited to a parameter range for the reproduction rate $\lambda<4$ but is plausible for any non-negative value. The bifurcation diagram looks qualitatively similar to the one of the logistic map.
