## Complexity Explorables

The Complexity Explorables are a collection of interactive web-based illustrations 
and simulations that help to develop an intuition about complex systems concepts. 

You can find them here: [https://www.complexity-explorables.org](https://www.complexity-explorables.org).

The site went online in 2017 with the first explorable. Meanwhile the site hosts around 50 
different explorables on various topics. Some illustrated famous models from complexity science,
others display more recent models.

If you want an overview of all explorables, go to [https://complexity-explorables.org/explorables/](https://complexity-explorables.org/explorables/).

<Explorable id="flockn_roll" margin={false}>    
    This is a popular explorable. It's about collective behavior and swarming phenomena in 
    animal groups. An explorable always has a display box, and a control box. Try playing
    with the sliders. Each explorable comes with a short text that descibes
    the model, explains the meaning of the control parameters etc. The text
    for this particular explorable isn't shown here. If you want more detail
    go to the original explorable [“Flock'n Roll” - Collective behavior and swarming](https://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/flockn-roll/).

### Open Source

Many explorables are available on github. I am currently working on making each Exporable's source code 
available on github. If you are interested check the repositories [here](https://github.com/dirkbrockmann?tab=repositories).
